# hairline-detect

A computer vision project for detecting and analyzing hairline patterns in images. This tool uses image processing and machine learning techniques to identify hairline positions, patterns, and characteristics.

## Features

- **Hairline Detection**: Automatically detect hairline boundaries in facial images
- **Pattern Analysis**: Analyze hairline patterns and shapes
- **Image Processing**: Advanced image preprocessing for accurate detection
- **Measurement Tools**: Calculate hairline metrics and measurements

## Purpose

This project aims to provide an automated solution for hairline detection, which can be useful for:
- Hair transplant planning and assessment
- Tracking hair loss progression over time
- Medical and cosmetic applications
- Research in dermatology and hair science

## Getting Started

More documentation coming soon.
